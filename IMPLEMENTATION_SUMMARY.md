  - ⏳ **Pending Button**: Changes status to "Pending"
  - 🗑️ **Remove Button**: Deletes application from CMS
- **Filtering**: Filter applications by status (All, New, Pending, Approved)
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh after status changes

### 3. Projects Page (`/projects`)
- **Access Control**: Only visible to users with Client role
- **Personal Applications**: View only user's own submitted applications
